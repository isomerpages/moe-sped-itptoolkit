<h2>Multi-Agency Transition Meeting</h2>
<p>Since 2022, MOE has collaborated with MSF and SG Enable to implement the
Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM) in SPED schools to promote a person-centred
handover process to enhance the quality of life outcomes of SPED graduates
by supporting the aspirations and needs of the student. This meeting is
conducted for SPED graduates identified to be suitable for a place in Sheltered
Workshops (SWs) and Daily Activity Centres (DACs).</p>
<p>MATM is a meeting between the school, family and receiving adult agencies
to facilitate a clear and coordinated process of handover for students
and families from SPED schools to DACs and SWs. The meeting is facilitated
by a school staff and takes place in the final school year before the student
graduates.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>When can MATM take place?</h4>
<hr>
<p>MATM can take place at one of two junctures during the final school year: <strong>MATM With Intake</strong> and<strong> MATM After Intake</strong>.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>“MATM After Intake” is conducted after completion of the intake and interview
process have already taken place, and with an enrolment already being offered
by an adult centre. It serves more as a platform to discuss transition
support. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Features &amp; Benefits</strong>
<br>MATM With Intake allows adult centres to gain more holistic understanding
of the student and family to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support assessment suitability for enrolment, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for appropriate programmes and supports to meet his/her needs and
aspirations</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MATM agenda integrates aspects of intake assessment and interview process
by seeking information required about the student and from the family through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student’s sharing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School’s sharing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family’s sharing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The remaining intake assessment and/or family interview can be arranged
to take place after MATM, either within the same day or on a different
day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Suitable For</strong>
<br>Students and families who require significant support and may find it
challenging to participate in a direct assessment and interview format
by adult centres. &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>
