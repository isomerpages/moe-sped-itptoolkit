<h4><strong>Person-Centredness</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Person-centredness is a set of&nbsp;</em><strong><em>beliefs, attitudes, and expectations</em></strong><em>&nbsp;about the&nbsp;</em><strong><em>capacities and rights</em></strong><em>&nbsp;of persons with disabilities to live their lives in accordance with their own wishes, dreams, aspirations, needs and abilities. (New Directions, 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Person-Centred Thinking</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“focuses on the strengths, abilities and aspirations of the person with
the disability rather than making decisions that are focused on an individual’s
problems”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>recognizes that “every individual has feelings, preferences, hopes and
aspirations and those of people with disabilities are just as important
and achievable as anyone else’s. To achieve these aspirations, however,
individuals with disabilities may need the support of others”.&nbsp;</p>
