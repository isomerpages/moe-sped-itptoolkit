<p>Person-centred is a set of <strong>beliefs, attitudes, and expectations</strong> about
the <strong>capacities and rights</strong> of persons with disabilities to
live their lives in accordance with their own wishes, dreams, aspirations,
needs and abilities. (New Directions, 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When carried out in the correct spirit of person-centredness, the transition planning process ensures the student's voice is heard by seeking their input on their aspirations, strengths and concerns.</em>
