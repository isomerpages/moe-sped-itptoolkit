<h3><strong>Developing Outcomes: What You Should Avoid</strong></h3>
<h4><em>1) Embedding the solution in the outcome</em></h4>
<p>A solution is a resource/item/activity needed to achieve the goal. When
outcomes embed a solution, we restrict options for the student by pre-determining
our expectation for him/her. This undermines the impact and possibilities
which could be explored in FEM Step 5.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><em>2) Not being specific enough in the outcome</em></h4>
<p>An outcome is the WHAT, not the HOW. Outcomes that are too vague, overly
generic or lacking in context are not specific enough outcomes. Lack of
specificity undermines the impact on the student as it will be unclear
what is expected of him/her even if the outcome is engaged in.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><em>3) Not linking the outcome with what matters to the person</em></h4>
<p>We need to make sure that we link the outcome with what is important for/to
the student. Not considering what matters for/to the student can result
in outcomes that are deficit-focussed rather than strengths-focussed and
reduces the impact on him/her.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><em>4) Using jargon or service speak</em></h4>
<p>Jargon/service speak refers to specialised or technical language which
can only be understood by service professionals. When an outcome is written
in this way, it excludes non-professionals and the student from participating
in the exercise of developing outcomes.</p>
