<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is a core feature in Special Education (SPED).
In particular, PCP features strongly in Transition Planning to uncover
each student's strengths, interests, and aspirations to help them achieve
their dreams and aspirations when they graduate.</p>
<p>Implementing PCP in Transition Planning is a systematic process that fosters
strong collaboration between educators and families. Through such partnerships,
SPED students will be empowered to achieve the SPED 'Living, Learning,
Working' (LLW) Outcomes.</p>
