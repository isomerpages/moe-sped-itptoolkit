<h4><strong>Person-Centred Planning</strong></h4>
<p>At its core, person-centred planning shifts our focus from perceived needs
to the genuine aspirations of individuals with disabilities. It's a transformative
process that puts the individual in the driver's seat of their own life
journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine a world where every person with a disability has the power to
shape their own future, where their voice is not just heard but actively
sought out and respected. This is the world that person-centred planning
aims to create.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Principles</strong>
<br>•<strong> </strong>Placing the individual at the heart of all decision-making&nbsp;
<br>• Prioritising personal aspirations over perceived limitations&nbsp;
<br>• Focusing on strengths and capabilities, not deficits&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The narrative around disability support is usually dominated by the voices
of caregivers, professionals, and society at large. While well-intentioned,
this approach often inadvertently sidelines the very people it aims to
support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Person-centred planning flips this script. It recognises that no one is
more expert in a person's life than the individual themselves. By actively
involving people with disabilities in planning for their lives, we ensure
that the support provided truly reflects their own aspirations, choices,
and dreams.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Person-centred planning is not a one-time event, but an ongoing journey.
It starts with understanding the individual's hopes and dreams and involves
creating a 'circle of support' chosen by the person themselves. Personalised,
actionable plans are developed to help achieve their life goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key elements of the process include:&nbsp;
<br>• Introducing Transition Planning to families when their child turns 13&nbsp;
<br>• Development of an Individual Transition Plan with post-school goals&nbsp;
<br>• Family envisioning meetings to generate personalised post-school goals
<br>• A coordinated and person-centred handover process from schools to adult
agencies&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But perhaps most importantly, person-centred planning is about <strong>doing things with people, not for them</strong>.
It's about empowering individuals to take control of their own lives and
futures, with the right support in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By embracing this approach, we move towards a more inclusive society where
every voice is valued, and every individual has the opportunity to live
life on their own terms. This shift in both mental and practice paradigms
is essential to achieve the true spirit of Person-Centred Planning and
realise better quality of life outcomes for individuals with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">People from different backgrounds and cultures may view and support persons
with disabilities in different ways. Key to the process of focussing on
an individual’s strengths, abilities and aspirations is understanding where
he/she lives and who is involved in his/her life.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-title">Taking Risks</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Dignity involves having the ability to take risks. Protection from failure
can also mean protection from success. In implementing PCP, we must examine
our personal prejudices and perspectives to determine whether risk aversion
arises from genuine concern or untested preconceptions.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-title">Dynamic Perspective</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Honouring a person’s choice means honouring that his/her interests and
aspirations may change over time. Implementing PCP requires us to be always
ready to shift our perspectives and consistently question our assumptions.</div>

<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is a core feature in Special Education (SPED).
In particular, PCP features strongly in Transition Planning to uncover
each student's strengths, interests, and aspirations to help them achieve
their dreams and aspirations when they graduate.</p>
<p>Implementing PCP in Transition Planning is a systematic process that fosters
strong collaboration between educators and families. Through such partnerships,
SPED students will be empowered to achieve the SPED 'Living, Learning,
Working' (LLW) Outcomes.</p>
