---
<p>When we think about disability, we may over focus on the label and the
problems a person with disability has, and overlook the feelings, hopes,
and aspirations that he/she also has. This may leave them feeling depersonalised
and unheard in the process.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Person-Centredness</em> is...</strong></h4>
<p>An overarching philosophy that emphasises treating individuals with dignity
and respect, ensuring their unique needs and preferences are prioritized
in all aspects of care and support. Within this framework, <strong>person-centred thinking</strong> involves
actively engaging individuals in conversations about their goals, values,
and aspirations, fostering a deeper understanding of their perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Person-centred planning</strong> then translates this understanding
into actionable strategies, creating tailored plans that empower individuals
to achieve their desired outcomes while promoting their autonomy and well-being.</p>
<p>Together, these concepts create a holistic approach that places the individual
at the heart of all decision-making processes.</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">People from different backgrounds and cultures may view and support persons
with disabilities in different ways. Key to the process of focussing on
an individual’s strengths, abilities and aspirations is understanding where
he/she lives and who is involved in his/her life.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-title">Taking Risks</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Dignity involves having the ability to take risks. Protection from failure
can also mean protection from success. In implementing PCP, we must examine
our personal prejudices and perspectives to determine whether risk aversion
arises from genuine concern or untested preconceptions.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-title">Dynamic Perspective</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Honouring a person’s choice means honouring that his/her interests and
aspirations may change over time. Implementing PCP requires us to be always
ready to shift our perspectives and consistently question our assumptions.</div>

<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is a core feature in Special Education (SPED).
In particular, PCP features strongly in Transition Planning to uncover
each student's strengths, interests, and aspirations to help them achieve
their dreams and aspirations when they graduate.</p>
<p>Implementing PCP in Transition Planning is a systematic process that fosters
strong collaboration between educators and families. Through such partnerships,
SPED students will be empowered to achieve the SPED 'Living, Learning,
Working' (LLW) Outcomes.</p>
