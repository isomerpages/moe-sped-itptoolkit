<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is crucial in helping all Special Education
(SPED) students achieve their desired outcomes. As a core feature of Transition
Planning, PCP seeks to uncover and recognise each student's strengths,
interests, and aspirations. It will play a significant role in the Transition
Planning process across all SPED schools. This approach will involve more
structured planning and increased family participation in setting life
goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Implementing PCP in SPED will foster stronger collaboration between
educators and families. This partnership will support students in planning
for their post-graduation lives and support them in fulfilling their aspirations.
Through these combined efforts, SPED students will be empowered to achieve
the living, learning, and working outcomes of special education.</p>

<h4><strong>Person-Centredness</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Person-centredness</strong> is the overarching philosophy that
emphasises treating individuals with dignity and respect, ensuring their
unique needs and preferences are prioritized in all aspects of care and
support. Within this framework, <strong>person-centred thinking</strong> involves
actively engaging individuals in conversations about their goals, values,
and aspirations, fostering a deeper understanding of their perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Person-centred planning</strong> then translates this understanding
into actionable strategies, creating tailored plans that empower individuals
to achieve their desired outcomes while promoting their autonomy and well-being.</p>
