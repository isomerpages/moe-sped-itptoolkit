<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>The Ministry of Education will strengthen Person-Centred Planning as a
core feature in Transition Planning in all SPED schools by enhancing family
members involvement in the envisioning process. A more structured Individual
Transition Plan will be implemented to guide goal setting in important
life areas.</p>
<p>PCP in SPED will increase capabilities and collaboration between teachers
and families to support students in planning for their post-graduation
lives to fulfill their aspirations. Through this partnership, SPED students
will be enabled to achieve the living, learning and working outcomes of
SPED.</p>

<h4><strong>Person-Centredness</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Person-centredness</strong> is the overarching philosophy that
emphasises treating individuals with dignity and respect, ensuring their
unique needs and preferences are prioritized in all aspects of care and
support. Within this framework, <strong>person-centred thinking</strong> involves
actively engaging individuals in conversations about their goals, values,
and aspirations, fostering a deeper understanding of their perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Person-centred planning</strong> then translates this understanding
into actionable strategies, creating tailored plans that empower individuals
to achieve their desired outcomes while promoting their autonomy and well-being.</p>

<p>Together, these concepts create a holistic approach that places the individual
at the heart of all decision-making processes.</p>
