<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>The Ministry of Education will strengthen Person-Centred Planning as a
core feature in Transition Planning in all SPED schools by enhancing family
members involvement in the envisioning process. A more structured Individual
Transition Plan will be implemented to guide goal setting in important
life areas.</p>
<p>PCP in SPED will increase capabilities and collaboration between teachers
and families to support students in planning for their post-graduation
lives to fulfill their aspirations. Through this partnership, SPED students
will be enabled to achieve the living, learning and working outcomes of
SPED.</p>

<h4><strong>Person-Centredness</strong></h4>
<p>Person-centredness is a set of&nbsp;<strong>beliefs, attitudes, and expectations&nbsp;</strong>about
the&nbsp;<strong>capacities and rights</strong>&nbsp;of persons with disabilities
to live their lives in accordance with their own wishes, dreams, aspirations,
needs and abilities. (New Directions, 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Person-Centred Thinking</strong></h4>
<p>“<strong>focuses on the strengths, abilities and aspirations of the person</strong> with
the disability rather than making decisions that are focused on an individual’s
problems”</p>
<p>recognizes that “every individual has feelings, preferences, hopes and
aspirations and those of people with disabilities are <strong>just as important </strong>and
achievable as anyone else’s. To achieve these aspirations, however, individuals
with disabilities may need the support of others”.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Person-Centred Planning (PCP)</strong></h4>
<p>“[A]ssists people to think about what types of things they would like
to have now as well as in the future, and it <strong>places the individual’s family and friends at the forefront</strong> of
helping to make those plans come into existence.” (O’Brien, 2004)</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A collaborative effort, involving those who know an individual well and
are willing to commit to taking the action necessary <strong>to support the person in achieving his or her life vision.</strong>”
(Abery and McBride, 1998)</p>
