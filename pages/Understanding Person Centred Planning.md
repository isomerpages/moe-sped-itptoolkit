<h4><strong><em>Person-Centredness</em>: The Heart of Person-Centred Planning</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Person-centredness</strong> is the overarching philosophy that
emphasises treating individuals with dignity and respect, ensuring their
unique needs and preferences are prioritized in all aspects of care and
support. Within this framework, <strong>person-centred thinking</strong> involves
actively engaging individuals in conversations about their goals, values,
and aspirations, fostering a deeper understanding of their perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Person-centred planning</strong> then translates this understanding
into actionable strategies, creating tailored plans that empower individuals
to achieve their desired outcomes while promoting their autonomy and well-being.</p>

<p>Together, these concepts create a holistic approach that places the individual
at the heart of all decision-making processes.</p>

<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is a core feature in Special Education (SPED).
In particular, PCP features strongly in Transition Planning to uncover
each student's strengths, interests, and aspirations to help them achieve
their dreams and aspirations when they graduate.</p>
<p>Implementing PCP in Transition Planning is a systematic process that fosters
strong collaboration between educators and families. Through such partnerships,
SPED students will be empowered to achieve the SPED 'Living, Learning,
Working' (LLW) Outcomes.</p>
