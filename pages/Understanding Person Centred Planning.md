<p>At its core, person-centred planning shifts our focus from perceived needs
to the genuine aspirations of individuals with disabilities. It's a transformative
process that puts the individual in the driver's seat of their own life
journey.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="isomer-card-title">Taking Risks</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Dignity involves having the ability to take risks. Protection from failure
can also mean protection from success. In implementing PCP, we must examine
our personal prejudices and perspectives to determine whether risk aversion
arises from genuine concern or untested preconceptions.</div>

<h4><strong>PCP in SPED</strong></h4>
<p>Person-Centred Planning (PCP) is a core feature in Special Education (SPED).
In particular, PCP features strongly in Transition Planning to uncover
each student's strengths, interests, and aspirations to help them achieve
their dreams and aspirations when they graduate.</p>
<p>Implementing PCP in Transition Planning is a systematic process that fosters
strong collaboration between educators and families. Through such partnerships,
SPED students will be empowered to achieve the SPED 'Living, Learning,
Working' (LLW) Outcomes.</p>
