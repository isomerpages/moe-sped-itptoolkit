<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to Support &amp; Actions</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Must the school cater to everything that the child wants? What if the school is unable to make arrangements for this support? </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ans: </strong>It takes a village to support a child. An important
paradigm to establish and sustain through FEM is that this is a team effort.
Everyone is involved in supporting the child to achieve his/her goals.
Resources can reside in many other places besides the school!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. How are supports and actions different from the educational goals &amp; plans that the [professional] has established for the child already? </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ans: </strong>Take a look again at the ‘outcomes’ the meeting
has arrived at and run it through the checklist in<em> FEM Step 5: Using the Outcome Sequence to Develop Goals</em>.
The most outstanding difference between educational goals and PCP outcomes
is that is does not focus on a behavioural modification but a specific
aspiration of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
