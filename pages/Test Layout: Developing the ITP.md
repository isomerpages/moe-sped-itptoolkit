<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is typically developed in tandem
with the One Page Profile (OPP), with the OPP attached to the front of
the ITP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</div>
<p>The OPP serves as a one-page summary of the student, highlighting three
key areas:
<br>• What people like and admire about the student
<br>• What’s important to the student
<br>• How best to support the student</p>
<p>This concise overview of the student's strengths, needs, and preferences
forms the foundation for the more comprehensive ITP, ensuring that the
student's voice remain at the forefront of the transition planning process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OPP is prepared with the student over time, incorporating input from
daily observations of family, school staff and others who know the student
well. It should be regularly updated throughout the school years and serves
as a valuable resource across all areas of the student’s life, extending
beyond just the ITP.</p>

<h4>Components of the Individual Transition Plan (ITP)</h4>
<p>The ITP comprises several key sections, each contributing to a comprehensive
view of the student and their transition journey. These interconnected
components ensure that the plan is holistic, personalised, and actionable.
