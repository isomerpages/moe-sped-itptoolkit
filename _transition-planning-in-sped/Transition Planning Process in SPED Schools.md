<h2>Overview of Transition Planning</h2>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The transition from school to post-school is challenging for students
with disability and their families as it brings up questions of what they
can do and where they can go after they leave school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every SPED school, Transition Planning takes place during the secondary
years to prepare students and families for a smooth transition to&nbsp;post-school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This important process is supported by a Transition Planning Coordinator
and transition teams in every school</p>
