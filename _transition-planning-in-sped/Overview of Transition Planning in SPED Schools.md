<h3><strong>Overview of Transition Planning</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The transition from school to post-school life can be a challenging time
for students with special needs and their families. It often raises questions
about the available opportunities and the next steps after leaving school.</p>

<li>
<p>In every Special Education (SPED) school, Transition Planning takes place
during the secondary years to prepare students and families for a smooth
transition to&nbsp;post-school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This important process is supported by the schoolâ€™s Transition Team, including
the Transition Planning Coordinator.</p>
