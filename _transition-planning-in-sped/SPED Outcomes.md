<p>The<strong> Learning Outcomes</strong> relate to continual and life-long
learning, emphasising the development of knowledge and skills that extend
over time, supporting <strong>ongoing growth</strong> and adaptation throughout
the student's life.</p>
<p>The <strong>Living Outcomes</strong> encompass a broad spectrum of essential
skills and values. These include <strong>personal management and safety</strong>,
which relates to effective management of personal affairs and well-being; <strong>community engagement</strong> which
fosters active participation and contribution within local and broader
communities; <strong>leisure activities</strong> for enjoyment and relaxation
while promoting a balanced lifestyle; <strong>positive interactions and relationships</strong> that
emphasise the importance of fostering meaningful connections with others
and <strong>responsible citizenship</strong> that underscores the need to
contribute positively to society, promoting a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>The <strong>Working Outcomes</strong> pertain to active <strong>contributions</strong> in
both the community and at the workplace, embodying principles of dedication
and service. This can provide a <strong>sense of meaning and fulfilment</strong> to
the student with the knowledge that he/she is making a difference in his/her
life.</p>
