<li>
<p>In the Initiating phase, when the student is 13 – 14 years old, schools
engage the family on student’s interests, preferences and strengths, as
well as their aspirations and concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Planning phase, when the student is 15 years old, the student together
with his/her family goes through the Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) for
the first time where the Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ITP is reviewed every year with a person-centred approach and all
relevant changes are updated in the ITP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Consolidating phase when the student is in his/her final schooling
year, the student and his/her family will go through the Multi-Agency Transition
Meeting (MATM) using the ITP to inform the handover process.</p>
</li>
