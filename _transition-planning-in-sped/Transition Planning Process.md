<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Initiating phase (13 – 14 years old<u>)</u></strong>, Transition
Planning is introduced to families and they are engaged to share their
aspirations and concerns, as well as talk about students’ interests and
strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Planning phase (15-16 years old)</strong>, a Family Envisioning
Meeting (FEM) takes place for every student and their family from which
an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is developed.&nbsp; The ITP is a continuation
of the IEP and contains the student’s post school goals, i.e. what they
would like to do when they leave school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ITP is reviewed every year through a person-centred approach to stay
relevant and updated.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Consolidating phase (final schooling years)</strong>, connections
and direct referrals to community pathways and resources are made for families
to help the student fulfil their post school goals. Meetings with these
agencies may be conducted to bridge the transition for families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
