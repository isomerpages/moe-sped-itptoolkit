<p>In the Initiating phase, which starts when the student is 13 – 14 years
old, schools are to engage the family on student’s interests, preferences
and strengths, as well as the family and student’s aspirations and concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Planning phase, which starts when the student is 15 years old,
the student together with his/her family goes through the Family Envisioning
Meeting (FEM) for the first time and Individual Transition Planning (ITP)
form is first developed.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ITP is reviewed every year through the person-centred format and all
relevant changes are updated in the ITP form.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Consolidating phase, the student is in his/her final schooling
year and the student, and the family will go through the Multi-Agency Transition
Meeting (MATM) using the ITP form to inform the process.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
