<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Initiating phase, which starts
when the student is 13 – 14 years old, schools are to engage the family
on student’s interests, preferences and strengths, as well as the family
and student’s aspirations and concerns.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Planning phase, which starts
when the student is 15 years old, the student together with his/her family
goes through the Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) for the first time and
Individual Transition Planning (ITP) form is first developed.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ITP is reviewed every year through
the person-centred format and all relevant changes are updated in the ITP
form.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Consolidating phase, the
student is in his/her final schooling year and the student, and the family
will go through the Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM) using the ITP
form to inform the process.</p>
