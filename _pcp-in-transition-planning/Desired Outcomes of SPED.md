<h4><strong>SPED Curriculum Framework and Desired Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>The SPED Curriculum Framework was co-envisioned and co-developed with
SPED schools and released in 2012 to provide SPED schools with a common
understanding and direction for designing and delivering a quality holistic
education. It also provides the flexibility and space for SPED schools
to customise their curriculum to the unique needs of their student profiles.</p>

the community when they graduate.&nbsp;</p>
