<p>Graduating from SPED can bring&nbsp;both excitement and a sense of uncertainty
about the future. As the post-school landscape continues to evolve, SPED
graduates will have increasing opportunities to pursue their aspirations
and needs in ways that meet their interests, strengths and talents. Let’s
explore the possible pathways and opportunities that our graduates can
look forward to as they embark on their post-school journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Community Services and Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates may access adult disability services offered by Social
Service Agencies (SSAs). These services include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sheltered Workshops where SPED graduates can engage in a range of vocational
tasks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day Activity Centres where SPED graduates can access recreational activities
and training in life skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling Services Hubs (ESHs) offer community programmes for persons with
disabilities and their caregivers closer to their homes. There is currently
an ESH in Tampines, Jurong and Punggol. Organised in collaboration with
community partners, they offer a range of social and recreational activities
that SPED graduates can choose from for leisure and social. They can also
pick up new skills and learn about a variety of topics, such as money management,
being aware of scams and puppetry, through the continual education and
learning courses provided at the ESHs.</p>
<p>SPED graduates can also tap on programmes offered by SSAs and other private
organisations, to continue exploring their interests after graduation.
These programmes cover a range of interest areas, such as in sports and
music.</p>
<h4><strong>Work and Employment Opportunities</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates are encouraged to consider a work pathway that meets their
interests, strengths and aspirations.&nbsp;SPED graduates can make a valued
contribution in one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Open employment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supported employment (with assistance from a job coach)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customised work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home-based businesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteering</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SPED students may also benefit from the School-to-Work (S2W) Transition
Programme. This is a collaboration between MOE, MSF and SG Enable to provide
job matching, training and job coaching for up to two years after graduation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Further Education and Training</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates are encouraged to consider pursuing further education,
training and learning after they graduate. This can take formal and informal
modes such as: &nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Post secondary education, e.g. Polytechnics, Institutes of Technical Education
(ITE) (For graduates with ‘N’ or ‘O’ level certificates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courses offered through SkillsFuture, Enabling Academy and other community
organisations</p>
</li>

<p>Self-learning, e.g. online courses, tutorials on video streaming platforms
such as YouTube, reading books</p>
</li>
</ul>
