third_nav_title: Transition to Post School
---
<p>The transition from SPED to post-school life marks an important milestone
for students and their families. This journey will be unique for each student
and family. As the post-school landscape continues to evolve, SPED graduates
will have increasing opportunities to pursue their aspirations and needs
in ways that meet their interests, strengths and talents. Let’s explore
the possible pathways and opportunities that our graduates can look forward
to as they embark on their post-school journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Community Services and Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates may access adult disability services offered by Social
Service Agencies (SSAs). These services include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sheltered Workshops for vocational training, providing various jobs/work
tasks for practice; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day Activity Centres for training in life skills and social/recreational
activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling Services Hubs (ESHs) offer community support for persons with
disabilities and their caregivers closer to their homes. ESHs are currently
located in Tampines, Jurong and Punggol. In collaboration with community
partners, they offer a range of social and recreational activities that
SPED graduates can choose from for leisure and social purposes. They can
also pick up new skills and learn about a variety of topics, such as money
management, being aware of scams and puppetry, through the continual education
and learning courses provided at the ESHs.</p>
<p>They can also tap on programmes offered by SSAs and other private organisations,
to continue exploring their interests after graduation. These programmes
cover a range of interest areas, such as sports, arts and music.</p>
<h4><strong>Work and Employment Opportunities</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates are encouraged to consider a work pathway that meets their
interests, strengths and aspirations.&nbsp;They can make a valued contribution
in one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Open employment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supported employment (with assistance from a job coach)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customised work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home-based businesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteering</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SPED students may also benefit from the School-to-Work (S2W) Transition
Programme. This is a collaboration between MOE, MSF and SG Enable to provide
job matching, training and job coaching support for identified graduates
up to two years after graduation.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Further Education and Training</strong></h4>
<p>SPED graduates are encouraged to consider pursuing further education,
training and learning after they graduate. This can take formal and informal
modes such as: &nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Post secondary education, e.g. Polytechnics, Institutes of Technical Education
(ITE) (For graduates with ‘N’ or ‘O’ level certificates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courses offered through SkillsFuture, Enabling Academy and other community
organisations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-learning, e.g. online courses, tutorials on video streaming platforms
such as YouTube, reading books</p>

</ul>
