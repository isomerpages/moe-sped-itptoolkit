<h3><strong>What is the Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM)</strong></h3>
<p>For SPED graduates with plans to enrol in a Sheltered Workshop or Day
Activity Centre, MOE and SG Enable coordinate a Multi-Agency Transition
Meeting (MATM) to facilitate the transition for students and families.
This meeting brings school personnel, family members, and staff from the
receiving agency together to facilitate a person-centred handover process
for each graduate.</p>
<p>MATM can take place at two junctures during the student’s final schooling
year:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>before an enrolment from the adult centre is offered (“MATM with Intake”),
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after an enrolment is offered (“MATM after Intake”).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;For more information on the two forms of MATM, families may reach
out to your child’s school.</p>
