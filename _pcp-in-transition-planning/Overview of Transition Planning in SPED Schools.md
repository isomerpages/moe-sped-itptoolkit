<h3><strong>Transition Planning in SPED</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transition from school to post-school life can be a challenging time
for students with special needs and their families. It often raises questions
about the available opportunities and the next steps after leaving school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every Special Education (SPED) school, Transition Planning takes place
during the secondary years to prepare students and their families for a
smooth transition to post-school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This important process is supported by the school’s Transition Planning
Coordinator and Transition Team.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Transition Planning in SPED schools involves 3 phases up to the point
of graduation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Initiating phase (13 – 14 years old<u>)</u></strong>, Transition
Planning is introduced to families and they are engaged to share their
aspirations and concerns, as well as talk about students’ interests and
strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Planning phase (15-16 years old)</strong>, a Family Envisioning
Meeting (FEM) takes place for every student and their family from which
an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is developed. The ITP is a continuation
of the IEP and contains the student’s post school goals, i.e. what they
would like to do when they leave school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ITP is reviewed every year through a person-centred approach to stay
relevant and updated.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Consolidating phase (final schooling years)</strong>, connections
and direct referrals to community pathways and resources are made for families
to help the student fulfil their post school goals. Meetings with these
agencies may be conducted to bridge the transition for families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
