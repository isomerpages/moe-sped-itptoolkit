<h3><strong>Overview of Transition Planning</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transition from school to post-school life can be a challenging time
for students with special needs and their families. It often raises questions
about the available opportunities and the next steps after leaving school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every Special Education (SPED) school, Transition Planning takes place
during the secondary years to prepare students and their families for a
smooth transition to post-school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This important process is supported by the school’s Transition Planning
Coordinator and Transition Team.&nbsp;</p>
