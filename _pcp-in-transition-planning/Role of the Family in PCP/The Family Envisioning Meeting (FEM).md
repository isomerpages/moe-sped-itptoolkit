<h4><strong>Role of the Family in PCP</strong></h4>
<p>PCP recognises families as the cornerstone of a child's support system
in special education. Families are active partners in the educational process,
bringing valuable perspectives that enrich the planning and implementation
of tailored educational strategies. Schools collaborate closely with families
, ensuring skills are generalised at home and learning goals reflect the
child's needs, interests, and preferences. PCP empowers families to work
with schools in planning for their child's life beyond SPED education,
aligning educational strategies with long-term aspirations.</p>
<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is a crucial component within the
PCP framework, providing a structured platform for families to articulate
their vision for their child's future. This process empowers parents to
advocate effectively for their child's interests and aspirations, ensuring
that the Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is aligned with the child's aspirations.
By fostering open dialogue between families and educators, FEM facilitates
the development of comprehensive ITPs that holistically address the child's
evolving needs, from current educational requirements to future life skills
and community integration.</p>

<p>FEM is a person-centred planning meeting that brings together <strong>the student and significant persons in his/her life to collaboratively plan for his/her future</strong>.
FEM embodies person-centred thinking and planning, placing the student's
unique voice, aspirations, and needs at the forefront of the conversation.</p>
<p>Key stakeholders, including caregivers, family members, school staff,
key professionals and others close to the student, are involved in this
collaborative process, contributing their insights while maintaining the
student's autonomy and centrality during the conversation.</p>
<p>FEM is first conducted as part of Transition Planning in the year of SPED
schooling when the student turns 15 years old, and is pivotal for the development
of the studentâ€™s first ITP.</p>
<p>The FEM process consists of 5 steps that guide the school in a conversation
with families to plan and prepare for future goals. <strong><a href="https://staging.d3j5q81zdtd1vn.amplifyapp.com/fem-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click here for the 5 steps of FEM!</a></strong>
