<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is a person-centred planning meeting
during which <strong>the student and significant persons in his/her life</strong>  <strong>collaboratively plan for his/her future</strong>.
FEM is a crucial embodiment of person-centred thinking and planning, serving
as a platform where the student's unique voice, aspirations, and needs
take centre stage.</p>
<p>Key stakeholders, including caregivers, family members, school staff,
key professionals and others close to the student, are involved in this
collaborative process, contributing their insights while maintaining the
student's autonomy and centrality during the discussion.</p>
<p>FEM is first conducted as part of Transition Planning in the year of SPED
schooling when the student turns 15 years old. FEM is pivotal for the development
of the student's first Individual Transition Plan (ITP).</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are 5 steps in FEM that help guide the school in a conversation
with families to plan and prepare for future goals.</p>
