<p>Transition Planning seeks to develop an Individual Transition Plan (ITP)
for every student to support his/her post-school transition.</p>
<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is a planning document that captures
the student’s aspirations for his/her future – interests, strengths, and
personal goals. It also reflects an action plan to support the student’s
successful transition to post-school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An ITP is developed for the student after the <a href="https://staging.d3j5q81zdtd1vn.amplifyapp.com/example-folder/fem-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM)</a> is
conducted when the student is 15 years old.&nbsp;The information garnered
from FEM forms the foundation of the student's ITP. This plan translates
the understanding gained from the FEM into actionable strategies that empowers
the student to achieve their desired outcomes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Importantly, the ITP is not a static document but a living plan that evolves
with the student. It is reviewed annually to ensure it remains relevant
and updated. It is important to adapt the plan to the student's changing
needs, preferences, and aspirations.</p>
