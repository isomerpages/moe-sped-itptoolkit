<p>Transition Planning (TP) empowers students to prepare for life beyond
school. As part of this process, we develop an Individual Transition Plan
(ITP) with each student.</p>
<p>The ITP captures the student's aspirations for their future, outlining
their interests, strengths, and personal goals. It also details an action
plan to guide the student's successful transition to post-school life.</p>

<p>*[Last updated: 14 May 2025] The ITP has been revised with <em>a new 'Planning my next Pathway' section</em>,
which captures&nbsp;important information and actions for post-school agencies
to support students' transition. This section will be completed in the
final schooling year, following the final ITP review and handover meeting.</p>
