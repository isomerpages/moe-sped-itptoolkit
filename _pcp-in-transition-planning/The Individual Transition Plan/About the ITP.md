<p>At the heart of Transition Planning is the development of an Individual
Transition Plan (ITP) for every student to support his/her post-school
transition.</p>
<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is a planning document that captures
the student’s aspirations for his/her future – interests, strengths, and
personal goals. It also reflects an action plan to support the student’s
successful transition to post-school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An ITP is developed for the student after the <a href="https://staging.d3j5q81zdtd1vn.amplifyapp.com/example-folder/fem-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM)</a> is
conducted when the student is 15 years of age.&nbsp; Key information garnered
from the student, family, school staff and others close to him/her, and
decisions on how to support his/her goals arising from the FEM, are captured
in the student’s ITP. The ITP is reviewed annually to ensure the information
stays relevant and updated. Click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sped-itp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to download a copy of the ITP.</p>
