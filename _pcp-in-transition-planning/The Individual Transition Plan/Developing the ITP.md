<p>The student’s OPP is attached to the front of their ITP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The OPP is a one-page summary about the student in three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What people liked and admired about the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s important to the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How best to support the student</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The OPP, a PCP tool, is prepared with the student over time. Information
can be collected from daily observations of the student, or their family,
school staff and people who know him/her well.</p>
