description: Information about the Transition Planning Process at SPED Schools
---
<p>As a student progresses to senior/secondary schooling in Special Education
(SPED), Transition Planning begins to prepare students and their families
for a smooth transition to&nbsp;post-school. The transition from school
to post-school life can be a challenging time for students with special
needs and their families. It often raises questions about the available
opportunities and the next steps after leaving school.</p>
<p>In every SPED school, the Transition Planning Coordinator and Transition
Team oversee and coordinate this important process where the school intensifies
partnership with families to develop a shared vision for the students’
future when they graduate from school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Transition Planning in SPED schools takes place over three broad phases
during the senior/secondary schooling years, leading up to the point of
graduation. The ITP is reviewed every year through a person-centred approach
to ensure goals remain relevant and updated.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Initiating phase (13 – 14 years old<u>)</u></strong>, Transition
Planning is introduced to families and they are engaged to share their
aspirations and concerns, as well as talk about students’ interests and
strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Planning phase (15-16 years old)</strong>, a Family Envisioning
Meeting (FEM) takes place for every student and their family from which
an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is developed. The ITP is a continuation
of the IEP and contains the student’s post school goals, i.e. what they
would like to do when they leave school.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Consolidating phase (17 years old to final schooling years)</strong>,
connections and direct referrals to community pathways and resources are
made for families to help the student fulfil their post school goals. Meetings
with these agencies may be conducted to bridge the transition for families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em><s><sub>Note: The</sub></s></em><strong><em><s><sub> Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM)</sub></s></em></strong><em><s><sub> is a coordinated and person-centred handover process jointly implemented by MOE, Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SG Enable to support SPED graduates transitioning into Day Activity Centres and Sheltered Workshops.&nbsp; </sub></s><sub> </sub></em><strong><em><sub>Propose to remove this as MATM is only one of the various pathways. </sub></em></strong>
