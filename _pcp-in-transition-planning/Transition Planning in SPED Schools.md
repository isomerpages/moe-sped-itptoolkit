---
<p>The transition from school to post-school life can be a daunting time
for students with special needs and their families. This step often raises
questions about what are the next steps and what is available post school.</p>
<p>In every SPED school, Transition Planning takes place during the secondary
schooling years prepare students and their families for a smooth transition
to&nbsp;post-school. A Transition Planning Coordinator (TPC) and Transition
Team oversee and coordinate this important process where the school intensifies
partnerships with families to develop a shared vision and a plan for the
students’ future when they graduate from school.</p>
<p>Transition Planning in SPED schools takes place over three broad phases
during the senior/secondary schooling years, leading up to the point of
graduation. The ITP is reviewed every year through a person-centred approach
to ensure goals remain relevant and updated.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Initiating phase (13 – 14 years old)</strong><u>,</u> Transition
Planning is introduced to families and they are engaged to share their
aspirations and concerns for their child, as well as talk about their child's
interests and strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Planning phase (15-16 years old)</strong>, a Family Envisioning
Meeting (FEM) takes place for every student and their family from which
an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) is developed. The ITP contains the
student’s post school goals, i.e. what they would like to do when they
leave school.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Consolidating phase (17 years old to final schooling years)</strong>,
connections and direct referrals to community pathways and resources are
made with and for families to help the student fulfil their post school
goals. Meetings with these agencies may be conducted to bridge the transition
for families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
