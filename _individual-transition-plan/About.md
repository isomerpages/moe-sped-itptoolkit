<h2><strong>About the ITP</strong></h2>
<p>At the heart of Transition Planning is the development of the Individual
Transition Plan (ITP) for every student to support student’s post-school
transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) captures the student’s personal aspirations
for his/her future, personal goals, strategies and supports, needed for
successful transition to post-school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first ITP would be completed after the Family Envisioning Meeting
(FEM), where schools would meet with families and the students when the
student is 15 years of age (i.e. start of Planning Phase of Transition
Planning), to generate personalised goals in line with common planning
areas. The ITP is a working document that is reviewed annually to the year
of graduation.</p>
