<h3><strong>Components of the ITP</strong></h3>
<p>To support Person-centred Transition Planning, the ITP features the following
key components:</p>

<h4>My One Page Profile</h4>
<p>An ITP needs to start with the student and who they are. The One Page
Profile (OPP) summarises this and should front the student’s ITP.</p>
<p>The OPP is prepared and updated before FEM and shared at Step 1 of FEM.
After FEM is completed, it may be further updated with information shared
at FEM and attached with the ITP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To complete the OPP, gather information from the student about the
people, places and things that matter. You can also gather these information
from your daily observation of the student, or ask family, school staff
and people who know them well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OPP provides a one-page summary about the student (from his/her perspective)
in three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What people <strong>liked and admired</strong> about the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s <strong>important to</strong> the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How best to <strong>support </strong>the student</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The OPP can be used in all areas of the student’s life, not just in the
ITP. It should be updated throughout the schooling year.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>My Person Details</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;These sections capture personal details of the student and family/caregiver.</p>
<h4><strong>My Aspirations</strong></h4>
<p>To support students to prepare for post-school, we need to know their
dreams and aspirations for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section could include their work aspirations and the life they want
to live. Information can be drawn from FEM Step 2.</p>
<p>It is helpful to record everyone’s views, including the family and internal
stakeholders who know and care about the student.</p>
