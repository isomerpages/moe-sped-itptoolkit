<h3><strong>Components of the ITP</strong></h3>
<p>To support Person-centred Transition Planning, the ITP features the following
key components:</p>

<p></p>
<h4>My One Page Profile</h4>
<p>An ITP needs to start with the student and who they are. The One Page
Profile (OPP) summarises this and should front the student’s ITP.</p>
<p>The OPP is prepared and updated before FEM and shared at <strong>Step 1 of FEM</strong>.
After FEM is completed, it may be further updated with information shared
at FEM and attached with the ITP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To complete the OPP, gather information from the student about the
people, places and things that matter. You can also gather these information
from your daily observation of the student, or ask family, school staff
and people who know them well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OPP provides a one-page summary about the student (from his/her perspective)
in three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What people <strong>liked and admired</strong> about the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s <strong>important to</strong> the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How best to <strong>support </strong>the student</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The OPP can be used in all areas of the student’s life, not just in the
ITP. It should be updated throughout the schooling year.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>My Person Details</strong></h4>
<p>These sections capture personal details of the student and family/caregiver.</p>
<h4><strong>My Aspirations</strong></h4>
<p>To support students to prepare for post-school, we need to know their
dreams and aspirations for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section could include their work aspirations and the life they want
to live. Information can be drawn from <strong>FEM Step 2</strong>.</p>
<p>It is helpful to record everyone’s views, including the family and internal
stakeholders who know and care about the student.</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>How I Communicate and Make Decisions</strong></h4>
<p>The student must be at the heart of decision-making and therefore, it
is important to know how the student communicates and can be supported
in decision-making.</p>
<p>Information can be gathered from<strong> </strong>the <strong>Preparation booklet</strong> that
was completed with the student before FEM. The use of PCP Tools like <strong>Communication Chart, Decision-making Profile and Decision-making Agreement</strong> can
help to elicit these information about the student.</p>
<h4><strong>My Strengths and Needs</strong></h4>
<p>This section summarises student’s strengths, needs and identified educational,
health and care needs based on information received from the student, family,
school, health and care professionals. To recognise the achievements or
affirm the strengths of the student, record of student’s experiences and
achievements (e.g. a sports medal or work</p>
<h4><strong>My Current Health and Care Needs</strong></h4>
<p>Health and care needs related to student’s Special Education Needs (SEN)
should be prioritized in this section.</p>
<p>Information gathered through the <strong>Preparation Booklets for Families and Professionals</strong> can
be captured in these sections. In addition, information shared during <strong>FEM Step 2</strong>,
can be transferred to these sections accordingly<strong>.</strong>

<h4><strong>What’s Working, What’s not Working</strong></h4>
<p>This section records key information on What’s Working What’s Not Working
in relation to the respective planning areas, as gathered through <strong>FEM Step 3</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an important step of the Outcome Sequence to develop goals. By
building on what is working, and change what is not working, the goals
should move the student closer to his/her aspirations.</p>
<h4><strong>My Goals and Action</strong></h4>
<p>This section outlines the student’s goals, and an action plan to support
attainment of the goals.</p>
<p>Goals developed from the Outcome Sequence at <strong>FEM Step 5</strong> can
be transferred into this section. The Transition Teams need to revisit
the goals after FEM to refine the goals and ensure they are specific and
measurable.</p>
<p>Actions and follow-ups from the Action Plan drawn up at<strong> FEM Step 5</strong>,
are also transferred into this section.</p>
<h4><strong>Contributors to my ITP</strong></h4>
<p>This section captures details of who has contributed to sharing of information
that is captured in ITP, as well as monitoring and assessment to review
the ITP.</p>
<p>The ITP is co-developed with the views and hopes of people supporting
the student. Everyone involved has a stake in the ITP. It is important
to for relevant people involved in developing the plan to be recorded in
this section.</p>
