<h3><strong>One Page Profile</strong></h3>

<p>The OPP is a one-page summary about the student in three key areas:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What people liked and admired about
the student</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What’s important to the student</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How best to support the student</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OPP should be attached to the front of the ITP. It is typically prepared
before FEM together with the Preparation Booklets. It should be prepared
with the student over time. You can also use data from daily observations
of the student, or ask their family, school staff and people who know him/her
well.</p>

<h3><strong>Developing the ITP</strong></h3>
<p>The ITP consists of the following sections:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ITP_Components_9_Sep.png">
</div>
<h4><strong>My Person Details</strong></h4>
<p>This section captures personal details of the student and family/caregiver.</p>
<h4><strong>My Strengths</strong></h4>
<p>This section captures the student’s strengths and abilities. It highlights
the student’s strengths based on information received from the student,
family, school, health and care professionals. The information highlights
the student’s achievements (e.g. a sports medal or prizes), strengths and
key work/volunteer experiences.</p>
<h4><strong>My Aspirations</strong></h4>
<p>This section captures the student’s thoughts, ambitions or dreams about
his/her future. Information gathered here could be about their work aspirations
and the life they want to live. Information can be drawn from <strong>FEM Step 2</strong>,
reflecting the views of student, family and school staff.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of aspirations shared at FEM:</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>How I Communicate</strong></h4>
<p>This section provides a summary of how the student communicates. Information
can be gathered from the <strong>Preparation Booklet</strong> or through
the use of appropriate <strong>PCP Tools</strong> like <em>Communication Chart, Decision-making Profile </em>and<em> Decision-making Agreement</em>.</p>
<h4><strong>My Needs</strong></h4>
<p>This section highlights identified health and care needs based on information
received from the student, family, school, health and care professionals.</p>
<p>Health and care needs related to student’s Special Education Needs (SEN)
should be prioritised in this section.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s Working, What’s not Working</strong></h4>
<p>This section records key information on <em>What’s Working What’s Not Working</em> in
relation to the respective planning areas, as gathered through <strong>FEM Step 3</strong>.
Information captured here are important because they are used in the Outcome
Sequence to develop goals.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<h4><strong>My Goals and Action Plan</strong></h4>
<p>This section outlines the student’s goals, and an action plan to support
attainment of the goals. Goals developed from the Outcome Sequence at <strong>FEM Step 4</strong> can
be transferred into this section. The Transition Teams need to revisit
the goals after FEM to refine the goals and ensure they are specific and
measurable.</p>

</div>
<p>Actions and follow-ups from the Action Plan drawn up at<strong> FEM Step 5</strong>,
are also transferred into this section.</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>My Transition Activities</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This section captures transition-related activities
needed to assist the student in attaining his/her postschool goals. These
activities might have been identified from the Support Sequence in <strong>FEM Step 5</strong> and
are needed to support the student towards his/her post-school goals (e.g.
researching on specific post-school service, applying for courses, linking
families up with services, making application, deputyship, etc). These
activities can greatly facilitate successful transition outcomes and should
be captured in the ITP for follow-up.</p>

<h4><strong>Contributors to my ITP</strong></h4>
<p>This section captures details of who has contributed to sharing of information
that is captured in ITP, and assessment of the ITP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ITP is co-developed with the views and hopes of people supporting
the student. Everyone involved has a stake in the ITP. It is important
to for relevant people involved in developing the plan to be recorded in
this section.</p>
