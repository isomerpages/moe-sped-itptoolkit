<p>How do our Special Education (SPED) schools cater to the unique needs
and the strengths of our students? From personalised education plans and
specialised staff to assistive technology and seamless transitions to post-
school life, we showcased the transformative impact of SPED schools. Hear
from students about their inspiring journeys, and gain insights from parents,
teachers and allied professionals who empower every child to reach their
fullest potential, both in and out of school.</p>
