<h4><strong>Person-Centredness</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Person-centredness is a set of&nbsp;</em><strong><em>beliefs, attitudes, and expectations</em></strong><em>&nbsp;about the&nbsp;</em><strong><em>capacities and rights</em></strong><em>&nbsp;of persons with disabilities to live their lives in accordance with their own wishes, dreams, aspirations, needs and abilities. (New Directions, 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Person-Centred Thinking</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>focuses on the strengths, abilities and aspirations of the person</strong> with
the disability rather than making decisions that are focused on an individual’s
problems”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>recognizes that “every individual has feelings, preferences, hopes and
aspirations and those of people with disabilities <strong>are just as important</strong> and
achievable as anyone else’s. To achieve these aspirations, however, individuals
with disabilities may need the support of others”.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Person-Centred Planning (PCP)</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“[A]ssists people to think about what types of things they would like to have now as well as in the future, and it </em><strong><em>places the individual’s family and friends at the forefront</em></strong><em> of helping to make those plans come into existence.” (O’Brien, 2004)</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>“A collaborative effort, involving those who know an individual well and are willing to commit to taking the action necessary </em><strong><em>to support the person in achieving his or her life vision</em></strong><em>.” (Abery and McBride, 1998)</em>
