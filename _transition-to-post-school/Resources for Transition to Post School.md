<h1>Resources for Transition to Post-School</h1>
<p>The time of graduation from school is a significant milestone that brings
with it joy, yet also uncertainty about what lies ahead. Families and caregivers
can be assured that they are not alone in this journey of transition to
post-school, and that they can access information to help them and their
children make informed decisions about their post-school lives.</p>
<p>One key partner in this journey is SG Enable, a registered charity established
by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) that focuses on
employment, community integration and continual learning for persons with
disabilities. For more information about SG Enable, please visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sgenable.sg</a>
</p>
<p>We encourage families and caregivers to explore the resources provided
by SG Enable, including the Enabling Guide and the Post-18 Interactive
Guide. These resources are designed to empower and equip them and their
child with valuable information and support as they navigate the post-school
transition</p>

and more.</p>
