<p>The main post-school pathways that SPED graduates progress on to include:</p>
<h3><strong>Post-Secondary Education</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are eligible may pursue vocational certification programmes
in Metta School or Delta Senior School at 17 years old. These schools offer
accredited vocational courses in selected industry areas leading to national
certification, namely the ITE Skills Certificate at Metta School, and the
Workforce Skills Qualification at Delta Senior School.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who attain the necessary qualifications such as the ‘N’ or ‘O’
Level certificates may pursue further education at institutions such as
Polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Work Settings</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SPED graduates may move on to open employment, supported employment, structured
internships or sheltered employment depending on their level of work skills
and work readiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may also engage in volunteering or home-based employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For students who require more support to be work-ready, they can embark
on a customised training pathways-cum-work option through the School-to-Work
(S2W) Transition Programme, a collaboration between MOE, MSF and SG Enable
(SGE). Students on the programme are matched to an appropriate employment
or training pathway prior to graduation. Upon graduation, students receive
customised job training with support from SGE’s job coaches for up to two
years, to prepare them for eventual employment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Care Settings</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SPED graduates who require more support may move on to care settings such
as Day Activity Centres, residential homes and drop-in disability centres.</p>
</li>
</ul>
