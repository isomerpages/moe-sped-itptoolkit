<h4>Preparing for MATM</h4>
<hr>
<p>To achieve a person-centred transition for the student to Adult Centres,
strong coordination and collaboration are needed. Successful MATM implementation
depends on ensuring key preparation activities are carried out by SPED
Schools and Adult Centres, as well as the student and family attending
the meeting.</p>
<p>Schools and adult centres may refer to the "Support and Resources" page
for materials that can guide the preparation for MATM implementation.</p>
