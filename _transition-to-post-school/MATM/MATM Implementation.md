<h1>Preparing for MATM</h1>
<p>To achieve a person-centred transition for the student to Adult Centres,
strong coordination and collaboration are needed. Successful MATM implementation
depends on ensuring key preparation activities are carried out by SPED
Schools and Adult Centres, as well as the student and family attending
the meeting.</p>

<p>Besides the Preparation Booklets, it is important to think about how all
meeting participants can<strong> receive the necessary support to be an effective contributor during FEM. </strong>This
support can come in many different forms and it really depends on an individual’s
preference. Some ways to support meeting participants might include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The Student</strong>: Ensure that the student’s One Page Profile
is updated and use PCP tools to support the student in filling up his/her
preparation booklet before the meeting</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Student’s Family</strong>:&nbsp; Anticipate their needs before
the meeting, and determine what will help them to understand what is most
important to the student.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Professionals</strong>: Share with them information about the
student’s background and any concerns raised by the family</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Preparation by Adult Centres</strong></h3>
<p>Adult Centres will be invited to share on their services and programmes,
and how these can be tailored to address the specific post-school goals.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The following resources should be prepared in advance:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Standing Flip Chart Paper and Markers to write on them &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standing flip charts are an important part of the PCP process because
of how information can be displayed to the whole meeting at once, helping
everyone to literally be ‘on the same page’ regarding the student.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Post-its &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Writing on post-its provides everyone, even the quieter individuals in
the room, the option to make their views heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post-its will be put up on the standing flip charts so that every
view will be given its proper ‘airtime’ and attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking post-its on standing flip charts may seem like a simple action,
but it’s a process that shapes the culture of the FEM meeting: One that
is safe, inclusive<strong> </strong>and where every individual is empowered
to have a voice and make a choice.&nbsp;</p>
