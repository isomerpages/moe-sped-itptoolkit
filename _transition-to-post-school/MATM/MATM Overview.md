<p>Since 2022, MOE has collaborated with MSF and SG Enable to implement the
Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM) in SPED schools to promote a person-centred
handover process to enhance the quality of life outcomes of SPED graduates
by supporting the aspirations and needs of the student. (to edit). This
meeting is conducted for SPED graduates identified to be suitable for a
place in Sheltered Workshops (SWs) and Daily Activity Centres (DACs).</p>

to facilitate a clear and coordinated process of handover for students
and families from SPED schools to DACs and SWs. The meeting takes place
in the final school year before the student graduates.</p>
