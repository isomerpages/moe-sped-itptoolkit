<h4>Multi-Agency Transition Meeting</h4>
<p>Since 2022, MOE has collaborated with MSF and SG Enable to implement the
Multi-Agency Transition Meeting (MATM) in SPED schools to promote a person-centred
handover process to enhance the quality of life outcomes of SPED graduates
by supporting the aspirations and needs of the student. (to edit). This
meeting is conducted for SPED graduates identified to be suitable for a
place in Sheltered Workshops (SWs) and Daily Activity Centres (DACs).</p>
<p>MATM is a meeting between the school, family and receiving adult agencies
to facilitate a clear and coordinated process of handover for students
and families from SPED schools to DACs and SWs. The meeting takes place
in the final school year before the student graduates.</p>
<p>MATM can take place at one of two junctures during the final school year: <strong>MATM With Intake</strong> and<strong> MATM After Intake</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>“MATM With Intake” integrates aspects of the intake assessment and parent
interview by the adult centre, before an enrolment is offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“MATM After Intake” takes place after enrolment has already been offered,
and serves more as a platform to discuss transition support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
