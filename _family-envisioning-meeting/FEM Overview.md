<h1>Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM)</h1>
<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is a person-centred planning meeting
in Transition Planning that brings together the student and significant
persons in his/her life – parents, caregivers, educators, and key professionals
– to collaboratively plan for his/her future.</p>
<p>Key to this process is harnessing the voices and aspirations of all stakeholders
to develop personal life goals for the student based on their interests,
preferences and strengths.</p>
<p>FEM is first conducted in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of secondary schooling
when the student turns 15 year old. FEM is pivotal for the development
of the student's first ITP.</p>
