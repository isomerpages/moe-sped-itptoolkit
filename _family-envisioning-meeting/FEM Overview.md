<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) captures <strong>a student’s personal aspirations for his/her future</strong>.
It comprises of a student’s personal goals, strategies and supports, needed
for successful post-school transition.</p>
<p>The ITP is developed <strong>at the start of Planning Phase in Transition Planning </strong>when
the student is 15 years of age to generate a set of personalised goals
with respect to common planning areas. It is <strong>a working document</strong> that
will be annually reviewed till the year of graduation.&nbsp;</p>
