<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<h3>Individual Transition Plan (ITP)</h3>
<p>The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) captures <strong>a student’s personal aspirations for his/her future</strong>.
It comprises of a student’s personal goals, strategies and supports, needed
for successful post-school transition.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Phase 1: Initiating | Phase 2: Planning | Phase 3: Consolidating Image&gt; </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ITP is developed <strong>at the start of Planning Phase in Transition Planning </strong>when
the student is 15 years of age to generate a set of personalised goals
with respect to common planning areas. It is <strong>a working document</strong> that
will be annually reviewed till the year of graduation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM)</h3>
<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is pivotal in developing the ITP
for the student, thereby ensuring a <strong>meaningful post-school transition </strong>for
him/her.</p>
<p>FEM <strong>brings together the student and significant persons in his/her life </strong>–
his/her parents/caregivers, educators and other professionals – to <strong>collaboratively chart his/her future</strong>.
This collective effort harnesses the insights of parents, the expertise
of educators and professionals; and most importantly, the voice of the
student to <strong>craft an ITP tailored to his/her needs</strong>.</p>
