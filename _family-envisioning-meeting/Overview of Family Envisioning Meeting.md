<h1>Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM)</h1>
<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is a person-centred planning meeting
in Transition Planning that <strong>brings together the student and significant persons in his/her life </strong>–
parents, caregivers, educators, and key professionals – to <strong>collaboratively plan for his/her future</strong>.
Key to this process is harnessing the voices and aspirations of all stakeholders
to develop personal life goals for the student based on their interests,
preferences and strengths.</p>
<p>FEM is first conducted in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of secondary schooling
when the student turns 15 yr. FEM is pivotal for the development of the
first ITP (full) for the student.</p>
