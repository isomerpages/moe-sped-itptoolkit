<h1>Determining Actions through Support Sequence</h1>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>The facilitator leads the participants in brainstorming possible ways
of supporting the student in achieving the post-school goals. This is done
through the use of the <strong>Support Sequence.</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>The Support Sequence</strong></h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The <strong>Support Sequence</strong> outlines different modes of support:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Yourself, i.e. the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment &amp; Adaption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family, Friends and Neighbours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services and Settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialised Support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Refer to these <a href="/support-sequence-guiding-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guiding questions</a> for
more ideas of how to generate possible supports with the Support Sequence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After determining the possible supports, the facilitator leads the participants
to set time-bound next steps using the <strong>Action Template</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>The Action Template</strong></h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 65%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Action_Template.png">
</div>
<p>The <strong>Action Template</strong> helps to set clear follow-up supports
and actions needed by the people supporting the student. Actions should
change the <em>'Whatâ€™s not working'</em> elements for the student, moving
him/her closer to the eventual post-school goals<strong>.</strong>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"I think that person-centered planning principles should guide our teaching as well. In PCP, the student (with family)'s voice is heard and this is the key to planning for teaching and learning. Schools and families can co-create goals and support the generalisation of skills. All planning can be based on strengths, preferences, and interests and learning needs, within the curriculum design of Teaching and Learning."</em>
