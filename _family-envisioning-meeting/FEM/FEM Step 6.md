<p>The facilitator leads the participants in brainstorming supports and actions
that help the student to &nbsp;achieve &nbsp;the post-school goals. This
is done through &nbsp;the<strong> <em>Support Sequence</em></strong> and
the <strong><em>Action plan template</em></strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>The Support Sequence</strong></h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The <strong><em>Support Sequence</em></strong> outlines different modes
of support:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Yourself, i.e. the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment &amp; Adaption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family, Friends and Neighbours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community and Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialised Support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Refer to these <a href="/support-sequence-guiding-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guiding questions</a> for
more ideas of how to generate possible supports with the Support Sequence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After determining the possible supports, the facilitator leads the participants
to develop an action plan using <strong>the <em>Action template.</em></strong>
</p>
<h2><strong>The Action Template</strong></h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Action_Template.png">
</div>
<p>The Action Template sets clear follow-up supports and actions including
curriculum needed by the people supporting the student. These should move
the student closer to the eventual post-school goals<strong>.</strong>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"I think that person-centered planning principles should guide our teaching as well. In PCP, the student (with family)'s voice is heard and this is the key to planning for teaching and learning. Schools and families can co-create goals and support the generalisation of skills. All planning can be based on strengths, preferences, and interests and learning needs, within the curriculum design of Teaching and Learning."</em>
