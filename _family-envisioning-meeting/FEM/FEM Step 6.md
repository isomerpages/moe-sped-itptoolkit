<h4>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to Support &amp; Actions</h4>
<p>1. Must the school cater to everything that the child wants? What if the
School is unable to make arrangements for this support?</p>
<p><strong>Ans: </strong>It takes a village to support a child. An important
paradigm to establish and sustain through FEM is that this is a team effort
– Everyone is involved in supporting the child to achieve his goals. If
you are creative about it, resources can reside in many other places beside
the school!</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. How are supports and actions different from the educational goals &amp;
plans that [professional] has established for the child already?</p>
<p><strong>Ans: </strong>Take a look again at the ‘outcomes’ the meeting
has arrived at and run it through the checklist in FEM Step 5. The most
outstanding difference between educational goals and PCP outcomes is that
is does not focus on a behavioural modification but a specific aspiration
of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
