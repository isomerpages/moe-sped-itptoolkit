<p>The facilitator engages participants to think about What’s Working and
What’s not Working for the student in the following 4 areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building my <strong>independence </strong>skills: <em>This considers student’s abilities in personal care and management, including safety and health.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating in <strong>daily, social and leisure</strong> activities in
the community: <em>This is about having friends, participating in leisure activities and community engagement.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing my <strong>learning</strong>: <em>This is related to continual learning, training, therapy for the student.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing<strong> productively</strong>: <em>This considers how student is prepared for meaningful contribution including employment, work, volunteering, home-based work or household chores.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants may reference what was shared in the previous Step, ‘Eliciting
Contributions about the Student’ e.g. ‘My Aspirations’, ‘What’s Important
to me?’ &nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants may verbally express their views in turn or write their views
on post-its which they paste on respective flipcharts<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Design Element &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>PCP SPOTLIGHT: Important TO and Important FOR</p>
<p>In eliciting contributions from participants, it is important for the
facilitator to aim for a balance of views between what is important TO
the student and what is important FOR the student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's Important TO the student?</p>
<p>What makes life worth living for the student?</p>
<p>What makes life pleasurable and fun?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</ul>
<p>Time to eat with his/her family</p>
<p>Enjoy playing music</p>

<p>Going for an annual holiday</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's Important FOR the student?</p>
<p>What does the student ought to do?</p>
<p>What do we nag the student to do more or less of?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
