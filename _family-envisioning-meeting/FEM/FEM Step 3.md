<p>The facilitator engages participants to think about What’s Working and
What’s not Working for the student in the following 4 areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building my <strong>independence </strong>skills: <em>This considers student’s abilities in personal care and management, including safety and health</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating in <strong>daily, social and leisure</strong> activities in
the community: <em>This is about having friends, participating in leisure activities and community engagement</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing my <strong>learning</strong>: <em>This is related to continual learning, training and therapy for the student</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing<strong> productively</strong>: <em>This considers how student is prepared for meaningful contributions including employment, work, volunteering, home-based work or household chores</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants may reference what was shared in the previous step, ‘Eliciting
Contributions about the Student’ i.e. ‘My Aspirations’, ‘What’s Important
to me?’ &nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants may verbally express their views in turn or write their views
on post-its which they paste on the respective flipcharts<strong>.</strong>
