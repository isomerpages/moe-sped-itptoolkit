<p>The facilitator engages participants to think about What’s Working and
What’s not Working for the student in the following 4 areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building my <strong>independence </strong>skills
<br><em>This considers student’s abilities in personal care and management, including safety and health.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating in <strong>daily, social and leisure</strong> activities in
the community
<br><em>This is about having friends, participating in leisure activities and community engagement.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing my <strong>learning</strong> 
<br><em>This is related to continual learning, training, therapy for the student.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing<strong> productively</strong> 
<br><em>This considers how student is prepared for meaningful contribution including employment, work, volunteering, home-based work or household chores.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants may reference what was shared in the previous Step, ‘Eliciting
Contributions about the Student’ e.g. ‘My Aspirations’, ‘What’s Important
to me?’ &nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants may turn take to verbally express their views. Alternatively,
they may write their views on Post-its and paste on respective flipcharts,
where everyone will move around to read the Post-its contributed by other
participants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PCP SPOTLIGHT: Important <u>TO</u> and Important <u>FOR</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In eliciting contributions from participants, it is important for the
facilitator to aim for a balance of views between what is important <u>TO</u> the
student and what is important <u>FOR</u> the student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's Important <u>TO</u> the student?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What makes life worth living for the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes life pleasurable and fun?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Time to eat with his/her family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy playing music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking his/her dog for a walk&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going for an annual holiday</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>What's Important <u>FOR</u> the student?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What does the student ought to do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we nag the student to do more or less of?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Examples:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Exercising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eating more fruits and vegetables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not binge-watching dramas</p>
</li>
