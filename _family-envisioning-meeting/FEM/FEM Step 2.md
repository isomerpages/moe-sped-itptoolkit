<p>The facilitator invites participants to contribute their views about the
student in the following areas:</p>
<p>a) <strong>What do we appreciate about the student?</strong> &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong>b) What are the student’s aspirations? </strong>
<br><em>The student’s thoughts, ambitions or dreams about his/her future.</em>
</p>
<p>c) <strong>What is important <u>TO</u> the student now?</strong> 
<br><em>What the student </em><strong><em>ought to</em></strong><em> learn, do or acquire because it will be beneficial in helping him or her to learn, live or work</em>
</p>
<p>d) <strong>What is important <u>FOR</u> the student now?</strong> 
<br><em>What the student </em><strong><em>appreciates, likes, or enjoys.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>These 4 areas are typically framed as standing flipcharts around the meeting
room.</p>
