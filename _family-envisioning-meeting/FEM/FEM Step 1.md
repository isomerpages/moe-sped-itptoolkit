<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP: Ground Rules</strong>
</p>
<p>Ground rules<strong> </strong>are important for setting the right tone
for the meeting as well as reminding everyone that it is a safe, respectful
and intentional space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The ground rules for the meeting should be discussed with the student
beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others can be invited to add some of their own ground rules to the list
during the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important that all participants understand and agree with these
rules before starting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
