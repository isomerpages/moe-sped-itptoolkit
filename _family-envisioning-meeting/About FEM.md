<p>The Family Envisioning Meeting (FEM) is a person-centred planning meeting
during which <strong>the student and significant persons in his/her life</strong> –
parents, caregivers, educators, and key professionals – <strong>collaboratively plan for his/her future</strong>.</p>
<p>Key to this process is harnessing the voices and aspirations of all stakeholders
to develop personal life goals for the student based on their interests,
preferences and strengths.</p>
<p>FEM is first conducted as part of Transition Planning in the year of SPED
schooling when the student turns 15 years old. FEM is pivotal for the development
of the student's first Individual Transition Plan (ITP).</p>

<p>There are 5 steps in FEM that help guide the school in a conversation
with families to plan and prepare for future goals.</p>
