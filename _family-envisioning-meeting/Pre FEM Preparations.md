<h1>Preparing for FEM </h1>
<p>The success of FEM hinges on <strong>thoughtful preparation </strong>before
the meeting itself takes place.&nbsp; This involves preparing the meeting’s
participants and ensuring that the room is properly set-up and ready with
relevant resources for an effective FEM.</p>
<h3><strong>Preparing the Participants </strong></h3>
<h4>Determine who attends the Meeting</h4>
<p>Besides the student, everyone important to the student should be present
in this meeting. This may include the student’s family members, caregivers,
significant adult figures, teachers or relevant professionals in the student’s
life such as speech therapists, occupational therapists or job coaches.</p>
<p>Once the participants have been identified, book their time for the meeting
and send them <strong>the Preparation Booklets</strong> about 6 weeks before
FEM. The Preparation Booklets serve as an effective PCP tool to help meeting
participants to <strong>understand what FEM is about</strong>.</p>

<h4>What are Preparation Booklets?</h4>
<p>Preparation<strong> </strong>booklets<strong> </strong>prompt everyone
attending the meeting to think about the student’s current reality, dreams,
and aspirations.&nbsp;There are Preparation Booklets for the Student, Families
and Professionals.</p>
<p>The booklets include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A brief introduction of what FEM is about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific questions tailored to the individual’s context to prepare them
for FEM</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to give detailed and specific input <strong><em>(Link to PCP Spotlight: Quality Person-Centered Information)</em></strong> in
their booklets. This will make it easier to develop meaningful goals with
the student during the meeting.</p>
<p>The information provided in the preparation booklets will be used during
the FEM. Participants can share responses that they have put down in the
booklets by writing them on Post-it notes and placing them on flip charts.</p>
<p>If someone important to the student is unable to attend FEM, this person’s
input can still be <u>captured in the preparation booklets and then voiced by another meeting participant during FEM.</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides the Preparation Booklets, it is important to think about how all
meeting participants can<strong> receive the necessary support to be an effective contributor during FEM. </strong>This
support can come in many different forms and it really depends on an individual’s
preference. Some ways to support meeting participants might include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The Student</strong>: Ensure that the student’s One Page Profile
is updated and use PCP tools to support the student in filling up his/her
preparation booklet before the meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Student’s Family</strong>:&nbsp; Anticipate their needs before
the meeting, and determine what will help them to understand what is most
important to the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Professionals</strong>: Share with them information about the
student’s background and any concerns raised by the family</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Preparing the Room</strong></h3>
<p>Besides the people attending the meeting, the environment where the meeting
is taking place is crucial.</p>
<h4>Resources for Facilitating FEM</h4>
<p>The following resources should be prepared in advance:</p>
<p><em>Standing Flip Chart Paper and Markers to write on them &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standing flip charts are an important part of the PCP process because
of how information can be displayed to the whole meeting at once, helping
everyone to literally be ‘on the same page’ regarding the student.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Post-its &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Writing on post-its provides everyone, even the quieter individuals in
the room, the option to make their views heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post-its will be put up on the standing flip charts so that every
view will be given its proper ‘airtime’ and attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking post-its on standing flip charts may seem like a simple action,
but it’s a process that shapes the culture of the FEM meeting: One that
is safe, inclusive<strong> </strong>and where every individual is empowered
to have a voice and make a choice.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Setting up the Space </h4>
<p>A carefully designed space will encourage active participation and create
a conducive atmosphere for open communication.</p>
<p>When setting up the space, consider factors such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Location of the room <em>e.g. Is it in a space that the student likes/is familiar with?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size of the room <em>e.g. Is it large enough to walk around but cosy enough for a small group?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layout of room <em>e.g. How will people be sitting? Where will each participant be facing?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background music, decorations, snacks, scents, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to actively involve the student in setting up the room, taking
his/her preferences into account!&nbsp;This is the student’s meeting and
he/she should own this part of the process as well.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; DESIGN ELEMENT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>TIPS FOR SETTING UP A ROOM FOR FEM</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ask the student about what music he would like to have playing in the
background and have it on loop to welcome participants when they enter
the meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put up photos of the student doing what matters to him or her around the
walls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the meeting, you can choose to extract information from the preparation
booklets and capture it in the form of Post-its to stick on the respective
flip charts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
