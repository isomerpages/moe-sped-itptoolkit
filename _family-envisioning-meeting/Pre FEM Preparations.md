<h1>Preparing for FEM</h1>
<p>The success of FEM hinges on <strong>thoughtful preparation </strong>before
the meeting itself takes place.&nbsp; This involves preparing the meeting’s
participants and ensuring that the room is properly set-up and ready with
relevant resources for an effective FEM.</p>
<h3><strong>a) Preparing the Participants</strong></h3>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Determine who attends the Meeting</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Besides the student, everyone important to the student should be present
at this meeting. This may include the student’s family members, caregivers,
significant adult figures, teachers or relevant professionals in the student’s
life such as speech therapists, occupational therapists or job coaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the participants have been identified, book their time for the meeting
and send them <strong>the Preparation Booklets</strong> about 6 weeks before
FEM.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What are Preparation Booklets?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Preparation<strong> </strong>booklets<strong> prepare meeting participants to engage in FEM </strong>by<strong> </strong>prompting
them to think about the student’s current reality, dreams, and aspirations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are Preparation Booklets for the Student, Families and Professionals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The booklets include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A brief introduction of what FEM is about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific questions tailored to the individual’s context to prepare them
for FEM</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Refer to the Preparation Booklets <a href="/preparation-booklets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to give <a href="/quality-person-centered-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">detailed and specific input</a> in
their booklets. This will make it easier to develop meaningful goals with
the student during the meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The information provided in the preparation booklets will be used during
the FEM. Participants can share responses that they have put down in the
booklets by writing them on post-it notes and placing them on flip charts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If someone important to the student is unable to attend the FEM, this
person’s input can still be captured in the preparation booklets and then
voiced by another meeting participant during the FEM.</p>

<summary>Everyone plays an Important Role</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Besides the Preparation Booklets, it is important to think about how all
meeting participants can<strong> receive the necessary support to be an effective contributor during FEM. </strong>This
support can come in many different forms and it really depends on an individual’s
preference. Some ways to support meeting participants might include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The Student</strong>: Ensure that the student’s One Page Profile
is updated and use PCP tools to support the student in filling up his/her
preparation booklet before the meeting</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Student’s Family</strong>:&nbsp; Anticipate their needs before
the meeting, and determine what will help them to understand what is most
important to the student.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Professionals</strong>: Share with them information about the
student’s background and any concerns raised by the family</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>b) Preparing the Room</strong></h3>
<p>Besides the people attending the meeting, the environment where the meeting
is taking place is crucial.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Resources for Facilitating FEM</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The following resources should be prepared in advance:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Standing Flip Chart Paper and Markers to write on them &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standing flip charts are an important part of the PCP process because
of how information can be displayed to the whole meeting at once, helping
everyone to literally be ‘on the same page’ regarding the student.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Post-its &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Writing on post-its provides everyone, even the quieter individuals in
the room, the option to make their views heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post-its will be put up on the standing flip charts so that every
view will be given its proper ‘airtime’ and attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking post-its on standing flip charts may seem like a simple action,
but it’s a process that shapes the culture of the FEM meeting: One that
is safe, inclusive<strong> </strong>and where every individual is empowered
to have a voice and make a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Setting up the Space</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A carefully designed space will encourage active participation and create
a conducive atmosphere for open communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When setting up the space, consider factors such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Location of the room <em>e.g. Is it in a space that the student likes/is familiar with?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size of the room <em>e.g. Is it large enough to walk around but cosy enough for a small group?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layout of room <em>e.g. How will people be sitting? Where will each participant be facing?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background music, decorations, snacks, scents, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Remember to actively involve the student in setting up the room, taking
his/her preferences into account!&nbsp;This is the student’s meeting and
he/she should own this part of the process as well.</p>
