<p>The success of FEM hinges on thoughtful preparation before the meeting
itself takes place.&nbsp; This involves preparing the meeting’s participants,
materials, and ensuring that the room is properly set-up and ready with
relevant resources for an effective FEM.</p>
<p>A skillful facilitator for FEM is important for a successful FEM. Some
skills facilitators should develop include active listening, goal-setting,
planning, chairing a meeting and time-keeping.</p>
<h4><strong>a) Preparing the Participants</strong></h4>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Besides the student, everyone important to the student should be invited
to the meeting. This may include the student’s family members, caregivers,
significant adult figures, teachers and relevant professionals in the student’s
life such as speech therapists, occupational therapists or job coaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the participants have been identified, book their time for the meeting
and send them <strong>the Preparation Booklets</strong> no less than 6 weeks
before FEM for their completion.</p>

<summary>Understanding Preparation Booklets</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Preparation<strong> </strong>booklets<strong> prepare meeting participants to engage in FEM </strong>by<strong> </strong>prompting
them to think about the student’s current reality, dreams, and aspirations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are Preparation Booklets for the Student, Families and School Staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The booklets include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A brief introduction of what FEM is about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific questions tailored to the individual’s context to prepare them
for FEM</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Refer to the Preparation Booklets <a href="/preparation-booklets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The information provided in the preparation booklets is vital for FEM.
Participants are encouraged to give as <a href="/quality-person-centred-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">detailed and specific input</a> where
they can in their booklets. This will greatly facilitate developing meaningful
goals for the student during the meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If someone important to the student is unable to attend FEM, this person’s
input can still be captured in the preparation booklets and represented
during the FEM.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>It is important to think about how all meeting participants can<strong> receive the necessary supports to be effective contributors during FEM. </strong>Some
ways to support meeting participants might include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The Student</strong>: Ensure that the student’s One Page Profile
is updated and use PCP tools to support the student to express his/her
voice both before and during FEM. Strategies should be considered to help
the student participate e.g. helping the student to fill up his/her preparation
booklet, supporting the student’s communication needs through an AAC etc.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Student’s Family</strong>:&nbsp; Anticipate their needs before
the meeting, and determine what will help them to understand what is most
important to the student.&nbsp;E.g. Would any family member require an
interpreter? Would any family member need time to rest/food before starting?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>b) Preparing the Room</strong></h4>
<p>The physical environment for the meeting is crucial and hence care needs
to be taken to set up the room for impactful outcomes.</p>

<summary>Resources for Facilitating FEM</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The following resources should be prepared in advance:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Flip Chart Stands and Markers&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standing flip charts are an important part of the PCP process because
of how information can be displayed to the whole meeting at once, helping
everyone to literally be ‘on the same page’ regarding the student</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Post-its &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Writing on post-its provides everyone, even the quieter individuals in
the room, the option to make their views heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post-its will be put up on the standing flip charts so that every
view will be given its proper ‘airtime’ and attention</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sticker Dots</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>These stickers will be used by participants to indicate their votes during
FEM Step 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of stickers, participants could represent their vote by marking
it out with a marker too</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Name Tags</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As it may be the first time some of the members of the group are meeting
with each other, a name tag will be helpful for participants to identify
each other in the meeting by name/role in student’s life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em>Good-to-have: Background music, decoration for room, snacks, scents, lighting etc.</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Besides the ‘necessary’ resources for conducting the meeting, you can
also have elements in the room that make the room and inviting and welcoming
space</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Setting up the Space</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A carefully designed space can encourage active participation and create
a conducive atmosphere for open communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When setting up the space, consider factors such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Location of the room <em>e.g. Is it in a space that the student likes/is familiar with?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size of the room <em>e.g. Is it large enough to walk around but cosy enough for a small group?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layout of room <em>e.g. How will people be sitting? Where will each participant be facing?</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Remember to actively involve the student in setting up the room, taking
his/her preferences into account!&nbsp;This is the student’s meeting and
he/she should own this part of the process as well.</p>
