<p>An effective and person-centred FEM culminates in a rich appreciation
of the student, and the development of a set of personal goals that builds
on the student’ interests, aspirations and needs. It also results in an
agreed action plan to support the student to attain the goals.</p>
<p>These are essential ingredients for the Individual Transition Plan and
immediately after the FEM, this information is transferred <strong>into the student’s first ITP</strong>.&nbsp;Please
refer to <a href="/individual-transition-plan/about-itp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the ITP </a>section
to find out how the ITP is developed.</p>
