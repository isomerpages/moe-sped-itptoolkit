<p>The facilitator engages participants to think about What is <em>Working</em> and
What is <em>Not Working</em> for the student in the following 4 areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building my <strong>independence </strong>skills: <em>This is related to the studentâ€™s developing abilities in personal management and mobility, including safety and health</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating in <strong>daily, social and leisure</strong> activities in
the community: <em>This is related to the student's motivation and ability to access the neighbourhood, interact with peers and friends, and participating in leisure activities</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing my <strong>learning</strong>: <em>This is related to the student's interest and motivation in learning, new knowledge and skills</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing<strong> productively</strong>: <em>This is related to the student's interest and motivation for work or contributing to the community, and how the student is responding to instructions and supports e.g. work experience</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
